<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Factive-directory-dotnet-graphapi-b2bportal-web%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>

[Detailed step-by-step deployment instructions](./Setup.md)

__Details__
* Allows self-service provisioning of guest accounts in a tenant. Portal enables this via API calls to the Microsoft Graph
* Leverages Azure DocumentDB. For development, a downloadable emulator is available: https://aka.ms/documentdb-emulator
* ARM template deploys the following:
  * Azure Web App
  * Azure DocumentDB
* Requires the following (see step-by-step deployment instructions above for details):
  1. Azure AD application with the following:
    * Microsoft Graph - app permissions
      * Read and write directory data
      * Read and write all users' full profiles
    * Microsoft Graph - delegated permissions
      * Sign in and read user profile
  2. Azure AD application with the following:
    * Microsoft Graph - delegated permissions
      * Sign in and read user profile
      * Multi-Tenant enabled
  * Optional - custom DNS name and SSL cert

__Operation__

* Guests access the home page and may enter their login email to request access to the host tenant/company. Optionally, they may click to "Require Sign-In" - this will allow them to login to the guest's home tenant, authenticate, then return with the form pre-filled AND with the request authenticated and validated.
* Once the request is submitted, the request will be queued in a DocumentDB repo.
* A user in the home company with the "Guest Inviter" role granted can then access the portal, log in, and browse the pending requests, either approving, denying, or leaving in a pending state for others to review. Additionally, internal comments can be attached to the request records.
* Optionally, authorized users may login and add a "Partner Organization" profile record. This will allow potential guests with a matching domain suffix, to be optionally auto-approved for B2B guest access in the tenant.
* Whether a user is automatically approved, or manually approved, once an approval occurs, a welcome email is generated to the requester with a link that allows for redemption of the request.
